## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

Learnt the following:

-- How to use flexbox and grid even for small layouts. 
-- BEM Architecture
-- How to change layouts depending upon the screen size by using media queries. I have made the code responsive based on the changes occured by shrinking the screen and not by giving a definite ipad, iphone screen size. By this way, the code is generic to all devices and not particular to single device.
-- How to use before and after pseudo elements.
-- How to get a line, circle by using just a single <div> element.

### Continued development

Would love to experiment more with Flexbox and Grid.
